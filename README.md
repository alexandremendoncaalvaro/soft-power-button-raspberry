So, this is a simple way to install and use a similar resource for Raspberry Pi with Raspbian.

## Requirements:
* Raspberry Pi with Raspbian
* Push-button (with or without LED)

>If your button have LED use a resistor to drop-down current  
Use this to calculate the resistor value: https://www.hobby-hour.com/electronics/ledcalc.php
